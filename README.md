Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking a cell in a 3x3 grid. The first player to achieve a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol (X or O) wins the game.

In this implementation, you can play against the computer or let the computer make the first move.
